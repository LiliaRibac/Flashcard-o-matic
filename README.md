I did a project at Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. The "Flashcard-o-matic" project in React has reinforced fundamental concepts of component-based development, state management, routing, API integration, event handling, and form management, contributing to a deeper understanding of building interactive web applications with React.
The project enhances user productivity and learning efficiency by organizing flashcards into decks, providing intuitive navigation between screens, and offering essential study tools like card flipping and session management. Users can easily create, edit, and study flashcards within their decks, enhancing their ability to retain and review information effectively.

1. Home Screen users can:
 * Create new decks for organizing flashcards.
 * View existing decks with their respective card counts and options to study, view, and delete.

2. Create Deck Screen
  * Allows users to create a new deck by entering a name and description; clicking "Submit" leads to the created deck's page.

3. Deck Screen
   displays detailed information about a specific deck, including its name, description, and a list of cards the users can:
  * Edit the deck details.
  * Study the deck's cards.
  * Add new cards to the deck.
  * Delete the entire deck or individual cards with confirmation prompts.
   
4. Study Screen
 Enables users to study the cards within a deck one at a time, with features such as:
  * Flipping cards to reveal answers.
  * Navigating through cards and restarting the study session if desired.
  * Providing feedback when there are too few cards in the deck.
Add Card Screen: Allows users to add new flashcards to an existing deck by providing front and back content.

 5. Edit Deck/Card 
  * Provides the ability to modify the content of an existing card within a deck, and clicking "Submit" leads back to the deck page.
